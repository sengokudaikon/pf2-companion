  "description": "<p><em>The convoluted histories other people cling to don't interest goblins. These small folk live in the moment, and they prefer tall tales over factual records. The wars of a few decades ago might as well be from the ancient past. Misunderstood by other people, goblins are happy how they are. Goblin virtues are about being present, creative, and honest. They strive to lead fulfilled lives, rather than worrying about how their journeys will end. To tell stories, not nitpick the facts. To be small, but dream big.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Goblins have a reputation as simple creatures who love songs, fire, and eating disgusting things and who hate reading, dogs, and horsesâ€”and there are a great many for whom this description fits perfectly. However, great changes have come to goblinkind, and more and more goblins resist conformity to these stereotypes. Even among goblins that are more worldly, many still exemplify their old ways in some small manner, just to a more sensible degree. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others' stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions' trash as the components of gadgets yet to be made.</p>\n<p>Though goblins' culture has splintered radically, their reputation has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and many work twice as hard at proving their worth.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is eccentric, enthusiastic, and fun-loving, you should play a goblin.</p>",
